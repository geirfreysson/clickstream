h1. Clickstream

Clickstream is a plugin that allows Rails applications to track clicks and clickstreams and associate them with users. Using Clickstream
you can monitor which clients/users log in most frequently, what your apps most common clickstreams look like etc. 

The plugin is written as a supplement to the Restful Authentication plugin but as long as certain functions are globally available it
supports any authentication scheme.

The functions that have to be available are:
* current_user
* logged_in?

h2. Installation

Install the plugin with
<code>script/plugin install git://github.com/geirfreysson/clickstream.git</code>

To create the tables used by Clickstream run the database migration task:
bc. rake db:migrate:clickstream

Next, include the module in the controller you want to monitor (or in the application controller to monitor all clicks) and add
a before_filter.

bc. include Clickstream
before_filter :follow_clickstream

Now all clicks are saved in the database and can be accessed and analyzed via the Stream objects.

Currently, we're only pulling up the most recent clickstreams and using that to analyze how our clients are using our products. We intend to
add more sophisticated queries once we have more data which will analyze common clickstream patterns etc.
